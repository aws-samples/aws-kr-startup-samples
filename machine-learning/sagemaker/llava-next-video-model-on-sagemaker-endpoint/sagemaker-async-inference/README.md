# Hosting LLaVA-NeXT-Video model on Amazon SageMaker Asynchronous Inference Endpoint using SageMaker PyTorch DLC

This is a CDK Python project to host the [LLaVA-NeXT-Video](https://llava-vl.github.io/blog/2024-04-30-llava-next-video/) model
on Amazon SageMaker Asynchronous Inference Endpoint.

[LLaVA-NeXT-Video](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/llava-next-video) is is an open-source multimodal LLM trained by fine-tuning LlamA/Vicuna on multimodal instruction-following data generated by Llava1.5 and VideChat.
It is an auto-regressive language model, based on the transformer architecture.
Video-LLaVA unifies visual representations to the language feature space, and enables an LLM to perform visual reasoning capabilities on both images and videos simultaneously.

Amazon SageMaker Asynchronous Inference is a capability in SageMaker that queues incoming requests and processes them asynchronously.
This option is ideal for requests with large payload sizes (up to 1GB), long processing times (up to one hour), and near real-time latency requirements.
You can deploy your model to SageMaker hosting services and get an endpoint that can be used for inference.
These endpoints are fully managed and support autoscaling.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.venv`
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-kr-startup-samples.git
$ cd aws-kr-startup-samples
$ git sparse-checkout init --cone
$ git sparse-checkout set machine-learning/sagemaker/llava-next-video-model-on-sagemaker-endpoint/sagemaker-async-inference
$ cd machine-learning/sagemaker/llava-next-video-model-on-sagemaker-endpoint/sagemaker-async-inference

$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
(.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Prerequisites

In order to host the model on Amazon SageMaker, the first step is to save the model artifacts.
These artifacts refer to the essential components of a machine learning model needed for various applications,
including deployment and retraining.
They can include model parameters, configuration files, pre-processing components,
as well as metadata, such as version details, authorship, and any notes related to its performance.

1. Save model artifacts

   The following instructions work well on either `Ubuntu` or `SageMaker Studio`.

   (1) Create a directory for model artifacts.
   ```
   $ mkdir -p model
   ```


   (2) Create `model.tar.gz` with model artifacts including your custom [inference scripts](./src/python/code/).
   ```
   $ cp -rp src/python/code model
   $ tree model
    model
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ code
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inference.py
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt

    2 directories, 2 files

   $ tar --exclude=".ipynb_checkpoints" -cvf model.tar.gz --use-compress-program=pigz -C model .
   $ tar -tvf model.tar.gz
    drwxr-xr-x  0 wheel staff       0 Jul 19 13:44 ./
    drwxr-xr-x  0 wheel staff       0 Jul 19 10:33 ./code/
    -rw-r--r--  0 wheel staff     109 Jul 19 13:30 ./code/requirements.txt
    -rw-r--r--  0 wheel staff    6110 Jul 19 12:17 ./code/inference.py
   ```

   :information_source: `pigz` is used to speed up the `tar` command. More information on how to install `pigz` can be found [here](#pigz-installation-guide).

   :information_source: The LLaVA-NeXT-Video model, which is used for making predictions, is downloaded from the HuggingFace Hub when the `model_fn` function in the `inference.py` file is called.

   :information_source: For more information about the directory structure of `model.tar.gz`, see [**Model Directory Structure for Deploying Pre-trained PyTorch Models**](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/pytorch/using_pytorch.html#model-directory-structure)

   (3) Upload `model.tar.gz` file into `s3`
   <pre>
   $ export MODEL_URI="s3://{<i>bucket_name</i>}/{<i>key_prefix</i>}/model.tar.gz"
   $ aws s3 cp model.tar.gz ${MODEL_URI}
   </pre>

   :warning: Replace `bucket_name` and `key_prefix` with yours.

   :information_source: This CDK project uses [`cdklabs.generative-ai-cdk-constructs`](https://awslabs.github.io/generative-ai-cdk-constructs/) to deploy SageMaker Endpoints. `cdklabs.generative-ai-cdk-constructs` library assumes the model artifact (`model.tar.gz`) is stored in a bucket on S3 with the word "`sagemaker`" or "`SageMaker`". Therefore, `bucket_name` must include the word "`sagemaker`" or "`SageMaker`". (e.g., `sagemaker-us-east-1-123456789012`, `SageMaker-us-east-1-123456789012`).

2. Set up `cdk.context.json`

   Then, you should set approperly the cdk context configuration file, `cdk.context.json`.

   For example,
   <pre>
   {
     "model_id": "llava-hf/LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B-hf",
     "model_data_source": {
       "s3_bucket_name": "<i>sagemaker-us-east-1-123456789012</i>",
       "s3_object_key_name": "<i>llava-next-video-7b-hf/model.tar.gz</i>"
     },
     "dlc_image_info": {
       "repository_name": "huggingface-pytorch-inference",
       "tag": "2.3.0-transformers4.46.1-gpu-py311-cu121-ubuntu20.04"
     }
   }
   </pre>

## Deploy

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
(.venv) $ export CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
(.venv) $ export CDK_DEFAULT_REGION=$(aws configure get region)
(.venv) $ cdk synth --all
```

Use `cdk deploy` command to create the stack shown above.

```
(.venv) $ cdk deploy --require-approval never --all
```

## Clean Up

Delete the CloudFormation stack by running the below command.

```
(.venv) $ cdk destroy --force --all
```

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!

## Example

Following [llava_next_video_async_endpoint.ipynb](src/notebook/llava_next_video_async_endpoint.ipynb) on the SageMaker Studio, we can invoke the model with sample data.
