# QA with LLM and RAG (Retrieval Augumented Generation)

> :heavy_exclamation_mark: This project is a simplified version based on the original project in the blog post, [Quickly build high-accuracy Generative AI applications on enterprise data using Amazon Kendra, LangChain, and large language models (2023-05-03)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/quickly-build-high-accuracy-generative-ai-applications-on-enterprise-data-using-amazon-kendra-langchain-and-large-language-models/)

This project is a Question Answering application with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Amazon Kendra. An application using the RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) approach retrieves information most relevant to the user’s request from the enterprise knowledge base or content, bundles it as context along with the user’s request as a prompt, and then sends it to the LLM to get a GenAI response.

LLMs have limitations around the maximum word count for the input prompt, therefore choosing the right passages among thousands or millions of documents in the enterprise, has a direct impact on the LLM’s accuracy.

In this project, Amazon Kendra is used for knowledge base.

The overall architecture is like this:

![rag_with_kendra_arch](./cdk_stacks/rag_with_kendra_arch.svg)

### Overall Workflow

1. Deploy the cdk stacks (For more information, see [here](./cdk_stacks/README.md)).
   - An Amazon Kendra for knowledge base.
   - A SageMaker Endpoint for text generation.
2. Open JupyterLab in SageMaker Studio and then open a new terminal.
3. Run the following commands on the terminal to clone the code repository for this project:
   ```
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-kr-startup-samples.git
   cd aws-kr-startup-samples
   git sparse-checkout init --cone
   git sparse-checkout set gen-ai/rag-with-amazon-kendra-and-sagemaker
   ```
4. Run Streamlit application. (For more information, see [here](./app/README.md))
